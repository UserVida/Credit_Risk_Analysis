# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Project 
The purpose of this project was to assess credit risk through a supervised machine learning model. Due to the inherently unbalanced classification problem involved with credit risk, different techniques in machine learning were utilized to train and evaluate the model. Six learning models were created using the imbalanced_learn and scikit-learn libraries. These models include:

1. Oversampling with RandomOverSampler
2. Oversampling with SMOTE algorithm
3. Undersampling with ClusterCentroid
4. Oversampling and undersampling with SMOTEEN
5. Reducing bias with BalancedRandomForestClassifier
6. Reducing bias with EasyEnsembleClassifier

The data used in this project was a credit card dataset provided by the peer to peer lending company, LendingClub.
